Statistics methods

Median is defined as the value separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half.
The numpy.median() function is used as shown in the following program.

Arithmetic mean is the sum of elements along an axis divided by the number of elements. The numpy.mean() function returns the arithmetic mean of elements in the array.
If the axis is mentioned, it is calculated along it.

Standard deviation is the square root of the average of squared deviations from mean. The formula for standard deviation is as follows âˆ’
std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))

If the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], then its mean is 2.5. Hence the squared deviations are [2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25] and the square root of its mean divided by 4, i.e., sqrt (5/4) is 1.1180339887498949


Variance is the average of squared deviations, i.e., mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2). In other words, the standard deviation is the square root of variance.
